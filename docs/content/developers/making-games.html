                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>
                                Games are a way to extend the functionallity of the application. The games themselves are made using <a href="https://www.monogame.net/">MonoGame</a>, which is a open-source, cross-platform game engine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mono Game is a really capable, it supports both 2D and 3D games and have been used to make games such as <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/">Stardew Valley</a>. If you stretch it a bit, you can say Mono Game is the C# alternative to PyGame.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The reason we use Mono Game is that it uses the .NET framework, same as the core application, meaning we get to use the same framework for the entire application.
                            </p>

                            <h2>How Does The Game System Work?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Games are as mentioned made with Mono Game, then the game itself is embedded into the application. They are loaded dynamically at runtime, and similar to extensions, they are isolated from the core.
                                The games access data from the core using the Mnemo API, which you could read about <a href="#api">here</a>.

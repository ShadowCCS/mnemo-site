                                Currently, the only way to get support by us directly is by visiting our <a href="https://discord.gg/mnemo" target="_blank">discord server</a>.

                                Here you can ask questions, get help with your problems, or just chat with other users, if the issue is severe enough, you can go to the "<strong>Support</strong>" channel and ask for help there.
                            </p>

                                However, most of the time you can find the answer to your question in the the documentation, but sometimes things might not work as expected.

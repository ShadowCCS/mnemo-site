                                This article will cover the basics of how games work in mnemo, and how you could use them to learn.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many studies have shown that games can be a great way to learn. Mnemo has a built-in game system where developers can create games and publish them. These games use data from the mnemo application through the Mnemo API.
                            </p>

                                <div>
                                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you want to create your own game jump to the <a href="#Games">Games</a> section.

                            <h3>How Do Games Work?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Games for mnemo are built around your learning content. Each game might use different sources of data, but they all work in the same way. In both the "<strong>Explore</strong>" and "<strong>Library</strong>" tabs, you can see the data that a game uses by a tag up in the right corner on the item.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That tag will show you what data the game is based around. For instance, if it says "flashcard" you know that you need a flashcard deck to play that specific game.
                            </p>
                            <div class="info-box">
                                <i class="ti ti-info-square-rounded"></i>
                                <div>
                                    If it says "mixed" you need to click the "<strong>details</strong>" button to see what data is used.
                                </div>
                            </div>

            The interface is made to be simple and easy to use with more advanced features hidden around the corner. Lets take a look.
        </p>

        <h2>Sidebar</h2>
        <p>
            The sidebar contains all the main navigation options within the application. It is collapsable and expandable by clicking the hamburger menu icon in the top-left corner.
        </p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Dashboard</h2>
        <p>
            The dashboard is the opening page of the application. It shows you your statistics and the option to jump back into a study session.
        </p>

        
        <p>
            The dashboard is split into two sections;
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The top section shows your statistics through widgets. You can add or remove widgets by clicking the <img src="assets/docs/Icon_widget.svg" alt="Show widget overlay" class="article-image" width="20px" height="auto"> icon in the top-right corner on the widget section then <img src="assets/docs/Icon_widget_manager.svg" alt="Open Widget Manager" class="article-image" width="auto" height="20"></li>
            <li>The bottom section allows you to jump back into a session by double clicking on the session you want to jump back into. If you right click you get more options such as <strong>Go To</strong>, <strong>Export</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Learning Paths -->
        <h2>Learning Paths</h2>
        <p>
            Learning Paths is a great way to study for exams or tests. You can upload any reference materials you want to study from; including PDFs, text files, youtube videos, and more, or simply write a prompt and let the AI generate a learning path for you.
        </p>

        
        <p>
            When the learning path is created, the first thing you will see is the unit overview. Most of them is grayed out, this is because the units are generated as you go. However, if you want to generate them all at once you can press the <strong>Generate All</strong> button, this allows you to also use the paths fully offline.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How To Use The Learning Paths</h3>
        <p>
            Each unit is divided into two sections: <strong>theory</strong> and <strong>practice</strong>. The theory section provides an article explaining the unit's concepts, while the practice options offer various ways to apply that knowledge.
        </p>
        
        <p>A short overview of the practice options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quiz</strong> - Creates a quiz to test your knowledge based on the unit theory (can be transfered to the quizzes tab)</li>
            <li><strong>Flashcards</strong> - Creates flashcards to help you memorize the unit theory (can be transfered to the flashcards tab)</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptive</strong> - The adaptive tab is a bit different. It is meant to be a more complete and interactive way to learn. It splits up the unity theory into even smaller chunks, then give you a few questions based on what you just read, then repeat the process until you have learned the entire unit.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Mindmaps -->
        <h2>Mindmaps</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Mindmaps</strong> are an excellent way to visualize and organize your knowledge, and they're incredibly easy to use. To create a new mindmap, just click the <strong>Create</strong> button in the top-left corner of the mindmaps tab.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When you start a new mindmap, you'll see a single node. Double-click it to edit its content. A single click selects the node, making a blue "+" button appear. Click and drag this button to automatically create a new connected node when you release the mouse. You can also drag this button onto an existing node to connect them.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            At the bottom of your screen, you'll find the dock. This is where you can create new nodes, customize styling, and access other features:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Edit</strong> - Modify node content, change colors, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Insert</strong> - A menu for adding various node types.</li>
            <li><strong>Icon</strong> - Access an icon library to spice up your mindmap.</li>
            <li><strong>Format</strong> - Apply styling options and control formatting.</li>
            <li><strong>Node</strong> - Adjust node-specific features like type and color.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Commands</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Commands</strong> are an efficiency tool that lets you quickly change node types without needing the insert menu. To activate a command, simply type a "<strong>/</strong>" inside a node, then follow it with the desired command.
        </p>
        <p>
          Available commands include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>h1</strong> - Switches to a header node</li>
          <li><strong>h2</strong> - Switches to a sub-header node</li>
          <li><strong>card</strong> - Creates a card node (contains a title and text)</li>
